# Monsters Rolodex :japanese_ogre:

## Project Overview
The Monsters Rolodex application is a React JS application which displays a list of monsters, and allows a user to search for these monsters. The application is based off of a Udemy Tutorial which can be accessed [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/). This is also a part of my 2<sup>nd</sup> round of the **100 Days of Code Challenge**.
